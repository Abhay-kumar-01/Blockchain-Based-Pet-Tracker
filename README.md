## Project Description

The Blockchain-Based Pet Tracker is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that provides a secure, transparent, and immutable system for tracking pets. This smart contract allows pet owners to register their pets, update their locations in real-time, and transfer ownership when necessary. By leveraging blockchain technology, the system ensures that pet information cannot be tampered with and provides a permanent record of each pet's history.

The smart contract stores essential pet information including name, breed, age, current location, and ownership details. It maintains a complete history of location updates and ownership transfers, making it an ideal solution for pet identification, recovery, and verification purposes.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a global, decentralized pet identification and tracking system that:

- **Eliminates Pet Loss**: Provides a permanent, blockchain-based identity for every pet that cannot be lost or destroyed
- **Facilitates Pet Recovery**: Enables quick identification and reunification of lost pets with their owners
- **Prevents Pet Theft**: Creates an immutable ownership record that makes pet theft significantly more difficult
- **Builds Trust**: Establishes a transparent system for pet adoption, breeding, and sales
- **Global Accessibility**: Provides a universal pet identification system accessible from anywhere in the world
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures that pet information remains accurate and cannot be maliciously altered
